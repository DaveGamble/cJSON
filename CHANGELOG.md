* fix several potential issues found by [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/cjson)
* fix potentially undefined behavior when assigning big numbers to `valueint` ([41e2837](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/commit/41e2837df1b1091643aff073f2313f6ff3cc10f4))
  * Numbers exceeding `INT_MAX` or lower than `INT_MIN` will be explicitly assigned to `valueint` as `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` respectively (saturation on overflow).
  * fix the `cJSON_SetNumberValue` macro ([87f7727](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/commit/87f77274de6b3af00fb9b9a7f3b900ef382296c2)), this slightly changes the behavior, see commit message

Introduce unit tests
--------------------

* Started writing unit tests with the [Cunity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) testing framework. Currently this covers the parser functions.

Also:
* Support for running the tests with [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org)
* Support for compiling the tests with [AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers) and [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html).
* `travis.yml` file for running unit tests on travis. (not enabled for the repository yet though [#102](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/issues/102)

Simplifications
---------------

After having unit tests for the parser function in place, I started refactoring the parser functions (as well as others) and making them easier to read and maintain.
* Use `strtod` from the standard library for parsing numbers ([0747669](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/commit/074766997246481dfc72bfa78f07898a2716473f))
* Use goto-fail in several parser functions ([#100](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/pull/100))
* Rewrite/restructure all of the parsing functions to be easier to understand and have less code paths doing the same as another. ([#109](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/pull/109))
* Simplify the buffer allocation strategy to always doubling the needed amount ([9f6fa94](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/commit/9f6fa94c91a87b71e4c6868dbf2ce431a48517b0))
* Combined `cJSON_AddItemToObject` and `cJSON_AddItemToObjectCS` to one function ([cf862d](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/commit/cf862d0fed7f9407e4b046d78d3d8050d2080d12))

Other changes
-------------
* Prevent the usage of incompatible C and header versions via preprocessor directive ([123bb1](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/commit/123bb1af7bfae41d805337fef4b41045ef6c7d25))
* Let CMake automatically detect compiler flags
* Add new compiler flags (`-Wundef`, `-Wswitch-default`, `-Wconversion`, `-fstack-protector-strong`) ([#98](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/pull/98))
* Change internal sizes from `int` to `size_t` ([ecd5678](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/commit/ecd5678527a6bc422da694e5be9e9979878fe6a0))
* Change internal strings from `char*` to `unsigned char*` ([28b9ba4](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/commit/28b9ba4334e0f7309e867e874a31f395c0ac2474))
* Add `const` in more places
