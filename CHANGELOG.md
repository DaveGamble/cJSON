1.3.2
=====
Fix:
----
- Don't build the unity library if testing is disabled ( #121 ). Thanks @ffontaine

1.3.1
=====
Bugfix release that fixes an out of bounds read #118. This shouldn't have any security implications.

1.3.0
=====
This release includes a lot of rework in the parser and includes the Cunity unit testing framework, as well as some fixes. I increased the minor version number because there were quite a lot of internal changes.

Features:
---------
- New type for cJSON structs: `cJSON_Invalid` (#108)

Fixes:
------
- runtime checks for a lot of potential integer overflows
- fix incorrect return in cJSON_PrintBuffered (cf9d57d56cac21fc59465b8d26cf29bf6d2a87b3)
- fix several potential issues found by [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/cjson)
- fix potentially undefined behavior when assigning big numbers to `valueint` (41e2837df1b1091643aff073f2313f6ff3cc10f4)
  - Numbers exceeding `INT_MAX` or lower than `INT_MIN` will be explicitly assigned to `valueint` as `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` respectively (saturation on overflow).
  - fix the `cJSON_SetNumberValue` macro (87f77274de6b3af00fb9b9a7f3b900ef382296c2), this slightly changes the behavior, see commit message

Introduce unit tests
--------------------

Started writing unit tests with the [Cunity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) testing framework. Currently this covers the parser functions.

Also:
- Support for running the tests with [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org)
- Support for compiling the tests with [AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers) and [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html).
- `travis.yml` file for running unit tests on travis. (not enabled for the repository yet though #102)

Simplifications
---------------

After having unit tests for the parser function in place, I started refactoring the parser functions (as well as others) and making them easier to read and maintain.
- Use `strtod` from the standard library for parsing numbers (074766997246481dfc72bfa78f07898a2716473f)
- Use goto-fail in several parser functions (#100)
- Rewrite/restructure all of the parsing functions to be easier to understand and have less code paths doing the same as another. (#109)
- Simplify the buffer allocation strategy to always doubling the needed amount (9f6fa94c91a87b71e4c6868dbf2ce431a48517b0)
- Combined `cJSON_AddItemToObject` and `cJSON_AddItemToObjectCS` to one function (cf862d0fed7f9407e4b046d78d3d8050d2080d12)

Other changes
-------------
- Prevent the usage of incompatible C and header versions via preprocessor directive (123bb1af7bfae41d805337fef4b41045ef6c7d25)
- Let CMake automatically detect compiler flags
- Add new compiler flags (`-Wundef`, `-Wswitch-default`, `-Wconversion`, `-fstack-protector-strong`) (#98)
- Change internal sizes from `int` to `size_t` (ecd5678527a6bc422da694e5be9e9979878fe6a0)
- Change internal strings from `char*` to `unsigned char*` (28b9ba4334e0f7309e867e874a31f395c0ac2474)
- Add `const` in more places

1.0.0
